# node_csv_read_write

### To start:

1. Clone repo to local machine
2. Run `npm install` in root of repo
3. run `npm start`
4. The application will read the contents of `enrollments.csv` and write the data out to a different csv file for each insurance provider that is contained in the csv
5. Currently, `enrollments.csv` contains 12 users (some of them duplicates) and 3 insurance companies so data will be written to `Humana.csv`, `Anthem.csv`, and `CareSource.csv`
6. The data in `enrollments.csv` can be updated to include more user entries if needed
